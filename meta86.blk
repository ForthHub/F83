It is similar in idea to   the ordinary notion of compiling in Forth, but has some         important differences.  First the code that is generated by the Meta Compiler is generally not immediately executable.  This maybe for a variety of reasons, such as that the object code       generated physically resides at a different address from where  it must be to execute correctly.  Also, it is possible through  Meta Compilation to generate a Forth System for a totally       different CPU than the one the Meta Compiler is running on.     In such a case, the object code of course is not executable     on the Host System.                                             This Screen is the load screen for the Meta Compiler itself.

Returns true if the string is a valid number in the current     base.  Note that a special test is made to make sure at least   one digit is present.  This prevents - from being a number.  \ Meta Compiler Transition Words                      10MAR83HHL(      Inherit ( from host for comments.
