This disk contains F83.COM, a public domain implementation of FORTH-83 that
is ready to run. It also contains source files in squeezed format.  I have 
squeezed them using the public domain utility NSQ and you can unsqueeze them 
with the NUSQ utility. Squeezed files have a Q in the file type.

The original Laxen-Perry distribution had these files squeezed with a program
that took hours (!) to run to unsqueeze. AUSQ will run in minutes and the 
squeezed files take up less space than the original distribution disk. Make B: 
(or C:) your default drive. Have plenty of room on your default drive and then 
type A:AUSQ A:filename.BQK to make filename.BLK on your default drive. 

CRCK4 or CRCK is a hash checksum program to help you tell if you have good 
copies of the files.  Type CRCK4 *.* (or CRCK *.*) and see if what you have 
agrees with the values listed below. This should assure you that you have a 
good copy of the disk. 

F83.COM is the ready to run FORTH system.  

The MS-DOS version is set up to use the IBM-PC cursor positioning codes.
This won't work on other MS-DOS machines such as the TI Professional. 
To fix this, start F83, then type EDITOR DUMB and you can use the editor 
commands as though you have a dumb terminal.
 
The VIEW word expects certain source blocks to be on drive A: and certain
source files to be on drive B:.  If you have a hard disk system, you can 
follow the directions in README.PC to recompile your system with all of the 
source blocks on your hard disk and the VIEW file numbers will be set up 
correctly.
