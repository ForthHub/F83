I apologize for the speed of this program (actually the lack thereof) but I wanted it to be totally transportable across     different machines, and hence all of the bit twiddling is       done in high level.  You could speed this up substantially by   writing @BIT and !BIT in code.                                  My thanks to Andrea Fischel for showing me how to recreate the  Huffman tree based on the compressed bit encoding.                                                                                                                                              \ Load Screen for Huffman Encoding/Decoding           09APR84HHL                                                                The purpose of this utility is to COMPRESS and EXPAND files     in order to save disk space.  A Huffman encoding is used in     order to achieve this compression.  An excellant description    of how Huffman codes work can be found in Volume 1 of Knuth.    The general idea is that a frequency table is built which       contains the number of occurances of each character in the      file to be compressed.  Based on this frequency table, each     8 bit byte is encoded as a variable length bit pattern.         Obviously, the frequently occuring bytes are encoded in less    than 8 bits, and the rarely occuring bytes are encoded in more  than 8 bits.  Very dramatic compression can be achieved with    this scheme.  In particular, BLK files can be substantially     compressed because of the large number of blanks present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \ Shared primitives - Double Number Helpers           09APR84HHLD+!

We read len bits      and either follow or create tree nodes depeding on the value    of the bit.  A leaf has a hex ff in byte 5, data in 4.       EXPAND-ENCODING   (S -- )                                          Initialize the tree to have 1 node, the root.                   Read through the compressed encoding description and            create the corresponding tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \ Expand the input stream                             29MAY84HHLLEAF?   (S addr -- f )                                             Return non-zero if the node at addr is a leaf of the tree.   EXPAND-BYTE   (S -- )                                              Read bits from the file and follow the branches of the tree     until we hit a leaf.  Return the corresponding char.         EXPAND-FILE   (S d# -- )                                           Read d# bytes from the input file and expand them, writing      the expanded data to the output file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \ Expand a Compressed File                            09APR84HHLINITIALIZE   (S -- )                                               Initialize variables, and get file names from input stream                                                                   EXPAND                                                             The first 16 bits of the file to expand must be 12345, or       else we are trying to expand a file that we did not             compress.  This would be fatal.  The length is in the           next 32 bits, followed by the encoding & the data.
